> Create a new Git feature branch for this assignment. See [Git Checkpoint Workflow: Before Each Assignment](https://www.bloc.io/resources/git-checkpoint-workflow#before-each-assignment) for details.

1. Read the [Philosophy section of the React Router documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy). In the submission text area, explain the difference between static and dynamic routing.

A: In static routing, you declare all routes up front and then listen for events.  In dynamic routing, you create components that take care of routing as needed after the page renders based on the state of the app (small screen vs. big screen or thisPage vs. thatPage).  Dynamic routing is responsive to change, static routing is not.  

2. Implement a third route named `album` for the Album page and create an empty `Album` component. There's no need to add a link to the navigation for this component.

> **When You're Done:** Commit your assignment work in Git. **Merge this assignment into the `master` branch.** See [Git Checkpoint Workflow: Mergeable Assignments](https://www.bloc.io/resources/git-checkpoint-workflow#mergeable-assignments) for details.
