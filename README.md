# bloc-jams-react

This is an online music player single page application built using React, React Router, and Material Design Lite.  You can navigate to the landing page or library page on the top navigation panel or the pull out drawer from the top left.  Once on the library page, you may select an album by clicking in the picture link.  From there, you see a table of songs with player controls (next song, previous song, play, pause, and volume controls). Here is the deployed site: https://bnreine-bloc-jams-react.herokuapp.com/
