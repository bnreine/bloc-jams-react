#### Questions

> There are two front-end frameworks that compete with React: [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Research these alternative frameworks to identify the differences between the three (React, Angular, and Vue). In the checkpoint submission, explain the differences, list the pros and cons of each framework, and include links to reference articles to back up your assertions.

React:


Angular:
* Develop across all platforms (https://angular.io/)

* speed, performance
  * large data apps (https://angular.io/)
  * control over scalability (https://angular.io/)

* great tooling
  * biuld featrues quick, declarative templates, declare your own components or use internanlly defined components

* Huge infrastructure
  * Used/maintained by google.  Used in their apps



Cross platform:
PWA (light, offline), native, and desktop

Speed/performance:
-turns templates into js code
-serves first view of app on node, php, and .net
-auto code splitting for fast routing, only need to load code for views they need

Productivity:
-make UI views w simple template syntax
-command line tools--> build fast, add components, tests, and deploy
-IDEs: auto-completion, instant errors in most IDEs

FUll Dev story:
-Karma for unit tests & Protractor...Tests faster and stable
-Animation...very little code using angular's intuitive api
-Accessibility...accessible components iwith aria-enabled components, dev guides, and built in a11y test infrastructure





Vue.js:
